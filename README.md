Project Type: Game Application

Explanation: Of the three options given, we decided on the game application choice for our final project because we’re hoping to work on a project that can be engaging and appealing to our interest in gaming. With this option, we were also given more freedom to choose what our project is about compared to a budgeting system or a task management system, as these options can be customizable but are limited to a certain amount of features. With our game, we are hoping to be able to either recreate our version of a well-known game with potential twists or create a game of our own.

By working together on this project, we hope to learn about what goes on when creating a game. For example, we hope to learn how we can create appealing UIs (the front-end side) and also handle the logic of the game itself (the back-end side).

Project Name: The Hangman Game

Project Description:
Our project will be a reworked version of the classic "Hangman" game, implemented using advanced Python programming techniques. We aim to go beyond the basic text-based implementation by incorporating the following features:
Graphical User Interface (GUI): We will develop a user-friendly GUI using a Python library like Tkinter or Pygame, providing a more visually appealing and interactive experience.
Difficulty Levels: Implement multiple difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) that affect the length and complexity of the words, as well as the number of allowed guesses.
Score Tracking: Implement a system to track and display the user's score, encouraging repeated play and competition.
Sound Effects and Animations: Add sound effects for correct/incorrect guesses and animations for the hangman figure, enhancing the user experience.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes and provide informative error messages.

Project Stages & Timeline:
First Stage (2 weeks)
We will plan how to approach this project.
We will design how the overall project will look like.
We will set up our project through github and write some initial code.

Second Stage (2 - 3 weeks)
We will continue where we left off and continue with coding.
When we encounter any obstacles we will work together to fix it.
As we are working on the project we may adjust our plan and adapt as we go along.
We will be testing as we go along to make sure everything works as expected (using UnitTest… assertEqual etc.).

Third State (until deadline)
By this stage we should be more than halfway done with the project and our project should begin to take shape.
We will write the remaining code to finish the project.
We will do final testing to make sure all the features are working as expected before submitting the project.



Technologies & Tools:
Python: Programming language for the game logic and GUI.
Tkinter or Pygame: Library for creating the GUI.
GitHub: Version control and collaboration.
IDE (Integrated Development Environment): VS Code or PyCharm.
Potential audio libraries: Pygame.mixer or similar.
Potential image libraries: PIL (Python Imaging Library) for image manipulation.
Unit Testing Framework: To test if our logic is working as expected.


Optional Info: When working on this project we will try to make this user friendly by using an easy to navigate UI of the application and overall make the application more appealing.
